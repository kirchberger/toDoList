# toDoList

Day 3 of my daily projects.
This is a program that can do todo list operations. Today I am parsing .todo files in ~/.todolists/

This format displays lines that start with # as sections, ## as tasks, ### as subtasks, and will ignore otherlines
Currently I need to generalize the code and be able to select the specific files.
